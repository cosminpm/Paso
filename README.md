# Paso

**Paso** is a procedural game currently in development. The main concept behind Paso is an infinite procedural level tale generator, featuring two distinct types of levels:

1. **Complete the Grid**: Navigate over all cells and then step on the final cell.
2. **Maximize Tales**: Step on as many cells as possible.

Below is an example of how the game functions. To create this experience, I employ procedural generation combined with pathfinding algorithms such as Depth First Search.
